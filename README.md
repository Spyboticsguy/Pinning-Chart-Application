# A2 Best Pinning Chart

A simple web application that calculates a pinning chart for the A2 Best system.

Not complete yet. Still needs functionality to:
- Actually take inputs for key biddings.
- Support more than a basic two-level system.
- (stretch) Be able to save charts for future use. For now just print them.
